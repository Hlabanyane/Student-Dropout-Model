# Student-Dropout-Model

**Student Dropout and Academic Success Prediction System**

**Project Intent**

The intent of this project is to develop an intelligent system capable of predicting student academic outcomes—specifically whether a student is likely to drop out, remain enrolled, or graduate—using historical academic and demographic data. The system leverages machine learning techniques to assist educational institutions in early detection of at-risk students, enabling timely interventions and improving overall academic performance and retention rates.

The project applies a comprehensive data science workflow, starting with data gathering, cleaning, and preprocessing to ensure dataset reliability. It uses a Random Forest Classifier, a robust and interpretable algorithm, to train and predict student outcomes based on features such as curricular unit performance, tuition payment status, age, and course details. Model performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.

To make the system accessible, a Streamlit-based web dashboard was developed. This dashboard allows users to input student data or upload a CSV file for batch prediction, view results instantly, and download predictions for reporting or analysis. The project demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in improving decision-making within educational systems and promoting student success.
